## Introduction

Swift does not offer any binary search implementation.
This proposal seeks to add few different functions that implement the binary search algorithm.

Swift-evolution thread: [[swift-evolution] [Proposal] Add Binary Search functions to	SequenceType](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012680.html)

## Motivation

When searching through wide arrays (more than 100k elements) the existing`SequenceType.contains( element: )`slows down exponentially.
This happens because it has to iterate the condition given for every element of the array. 

The algorithm used is linear search and has a complexity of O(n),
whereas the binary search algorithm always cuts the search space in half, thus having a complexity of O(log n). Obviously it is much more efficient on large **sorted** arrays, widely cutting down the waste of time and resources.

But that does not only apply to sorted arrays. 
In fact, even if a wide array was to be sorted once, the search would take so little that it still would be efficient in terms of time elapsed. 

## Proposed solution

The solution is adding these new functions that implement binary search, present in many other programming languages, called `binarySearch`, `lowerBound` and `upperBound`.

They would be added to any type using `CollectionType`.

## Detailed design

**1.** The main function is `binarySearch`, which exists in two versions: it accepts either the value of an `element` to be searched for, or a predicate `isOrderedBefore` to be satisfied. 

The function returns `nil` if not any are found.


**2.** Another one is`lowerBound`, which exists in two versions: it accepts either the value of an `element` to be searched for, or a predicate `isOrderedBefore` to be satisfied. 

The function returns `nil` if not any are found.

**3.** 

## Impact on existing code

The only change on code will be the availability of three (plus overloads) safer functions implementing Binary Search. 

Given the notorious difficulty for a programmer to implement binary search on their own, this proposal aims to simplify its use and thus reduce the amount of bugs in programs.

## Alternatives considered

The only alternative at this time is "no change" to the library.
