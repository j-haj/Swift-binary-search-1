## Introduction

Swift does not offer any binary search implementation.
This proposal seeks to add few different functions that implement the binary search algorithm.

Swift-evolution thread: [[swift-evolution] [Proposal] Add Binary Search functions to	SequenceType](https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160314/012680.html)

JIRA: [Swift/SR-368](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-368)

## Motivation

Searching through wide arrays (more than 100k elements) is inherently inefficient as the existing `SequenceType.contains( element:)` performs a linear search that has to test the given condition for every element of the array.

Sorting the array would typically improve the efficiency of this search from O(n) to O(log n) by allowing a binary search algorithm that always cuts the search space in half. Unfortunately, the standard library has no built-in ability to search on a collection that is known to be sorted.

## Proposed solution

The solution is adding four new functions that implement binary search, present in many other programming languages, called `binarySearch`, `lowerBound`, `upperBound`, and `equalRange`. They would be added to any type using `CollectionType`.

The following array will be used in the examples below:

    let a = [10, 20, 30, 30, 30, 40, 60]

- `binarySearch` implements a binary search algorithm that finds the position of a given value. For example: 

        a.binarySearch(20)      // 1
        a.binarySearch(30)      // 2
        a.binarySearch(50)      // nil
  
- `lowerBound` finds the position of the first element not less than a given value. If the value isn't found, the returned index is its lower insertion point.

        a.lowerBound(30)        // 2
        a.lowerBound(50)        // 6
        a.lowerBound(100)       // 7

- `upperBound` finds the position of the first element greater than a given value. If the value isn't found, the returned index is its upper insertion point.

        a.upperBound(30)        // 5
        a.upperBound(50)        // 6
        a.upperBound(100)       // 7

- `equalRange` finds the range of all consecutive elements that are equivalent to a given value. If the value isn't found, the range is empty with `lowerBound(value)` as its `startIndex`.

        a.equalRange(30)        // 2..<5
        a.equalRange(50)        // 6..<6

## Detailed design

**1.** The main function is `binarySearch`, which exists in two versions: it accepts either the value of an `element` to be searched for, or a predicate `isOrderedBefore` to be satisfied. 

The function returns `nil` if not any are found.


**2.** Another one is`lowerBound`, which exists in two versions: it accepts either the value of an `element` to be searched for, or a predicate `isOrderedBefore` to be satisfied. 

The function returns `nil` if not any are found.

**3.** 

## Impact on existing code

The only change on code will be the availability of three (plus overloads) safer functions implementing Binary Search. 

Given the notorious difficulty for a programmer to implement binary search on their own, this proposal aims to simplify its use and thus reduce the amount of bugs in programs.

## Alternatives considered

The only alternative at this time is "no change" to the library.
